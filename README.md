# Gulf of Mexico Cable Prioritization Modelling

This is the GitHub repository that details the cable site prioritization for the Gulf of Mexico offshore wind energy areas.

#### **Repository Structure**
* **data**
  - **raw_data:** the raw data integrated in the analysis (**Note:** original data name and structure were kept except when either name was not descriptive or similar data were put in same directory to simplify input directories)
  - **intermediate_data:** disaggregated processed data
  - **analysis_data:** processed data for analyzing
  - **raster_data:** raster data
  - **final_data:**
* **code:** scripts for cleaning, processing, and analyzing data
* **figures:** figures generated to visualize analysis

The full data repository is accessible on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AGuMCNFLcqwIMokV9GzwFpY74GubB1lb). You may need to request access to the folder.

**__Note for PC users:__** The code was written on a Mac so to run the scripts replace "/" in the pathnames for directories with two "\\".

#### Known limitations and issues
Currently R cannot open raster files from a geodatabase. Thus, the vessel traffic count data had to be opened in Esri software and then use the study area to mask the count data within that area.

Similarly, The KML data from [NDBC](ttps://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/obs.shtml), as of October 27 2022, can only be downloaded as a KML file. To open the data within R, they were first converted to a shapefile (or usable format) in Esri software.
